# Learn Lambda

This is a very simple Go-based Lambda project created to become more familiar with Go and AWS Lambda functionality.

## Goals

* *Establish basic project functionality.* Write code that illustrates some basic functionality of Lambda with Go. (In this case, that means generating a random number between 0 and "max".)
* *Add CloudFormation functionality.* AWS CloudFormation is used to provision infrastructure resources in a safe, repeatable way. Familiarity with CloudFormation will help with future projects.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Go can be downloaded [here](https://golang.org/doc/install).

AWS CLI can be downloaded [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html). Note: Installing the AWS Command Line Interface requires Python 2 version 2.6.5+ or Python 3 version 3.3+.
